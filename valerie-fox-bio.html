Valerie Fox is now in change-making mode, transitioning her role as DMZ’s Executive Director to launching a new company called The Pivotal Point, which brings the magic of the hugely successful DMZ incubator and Zone experience at Ryerson University to other academic institutions, corporations and regions that are looking to move into the digital age.
</p>

<p>
Community based incubation of continual, iterative, impactful innovation is now a necessity for economic and social prosperity. It needs to be everywhere and connected.
</p>

<p>
The next year of The Pivotal Point will be dedicated to helping others to building successful models that will bring communities of diverse skills and ambitions together to collaborate, create and transition to a world of transparency and shared resources.
</p>

<p>
As co-founder of the DMZ at Ryerson University, she was responsible for executing its development and growth. Opened April of 2010, the Zone has grown to be one of the most talked about tech incubators in Ontario, attracting and fostering the growth of 190 companies with over 1900 associated jobs in just 5 years. Its been ranked #1 university business incubator in Canada and #5 in the World. Ryerson Futures and the DMZ have now also enabled the development of ZoneStartups-India, a sister-Zone located in Mumbai, in partnership with the Bombay Stock Exchange.
</p>

<p>
Fox’s 30+ years of experience in facilitating organizational change, coaching, project management, innovation, communication strategy, user experience and creativity was the perfect fit for her initial role at Ryerson: facilitating student engagement. She has carried these skills over to her role at the Zone where she is principally responsible for making industry and institutional connections, bringing partnerships and collaboration to the Zone. Ultimately, Fox lends her expertise/leadership to the long-term goal of fostering innovation throughout Canada and the world.
