			<h2>Latino Hub</h2>
			<p>What does it take to build a critical mass?</p>
		</header>

		<p>
		We plan to find out. Together with government, academic, and investor support, LatAm Startups is building the first Latino Hub&mdash;a startup accelerator dedicated to scaling startups from Latin America.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Why Toronto?</h3>
		<p>
		For that matter, why Canada?
		</p>

		<p>
		Canada and Latin America are natural partners when it comes to high-tech innovation.
		Canadian startups go global from Day One&mdash;they have to. The same is true in
		Latin America.
		</p>
		<p>
		But Latin America lacks the deep experience of successful startup founders turned 
		angel investors. Innovation is getting cheaper with every year that passes, and LatAm
		startups are booming, but need guidance and capital in order to scale.
		</p>
		<p>
		Latino Hub Toronto will bring the best startups in Latin America to Toronto to mentor
		them so they can scale globally. 
		</p>
		<p>
		What's more, Latin America is a natural market for Canadian startups looking to scale. 
		A critical mass of LatAm startups in Toronto will dramatically increase bilateral
		trade between Canada and Latin America, boost both startup ecosystems, and decrease
		reliance on Silicon Valley.
		</p>
		<p>
		Innovation Independence. That's what it's all about.
