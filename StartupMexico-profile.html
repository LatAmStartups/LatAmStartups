Startup Mexico is the first innovation campus for entrepreneurs in Mexico. It is a super hub that includes recently established high-impact businesses, seed funds, corporate implants and services for entrepreneurs, all under the same roof, to create a new type of ecosystem that encourages collaboration, innovation and a more competitive Mexico.

Since Startup Mexico is a comprehensive platform, there is a lot you can expect from us. Some of our most important features are: seed money for program participants, fully equipped offices for entrepreneurs, the best mentoring of the country, access to diverse services, learning talks, workshops and networking, linkage to the ecosystem, funds and accelerators, corporate offices, etc. We also help you with your project, giving advice on corporate governance, promotion and advertising, internationalization support and, most importantly, a great deal of support from the SUM family.
