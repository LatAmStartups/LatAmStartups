The image of a kid honing his leadership skills by starting a community lemonade stand definitely fits Peter Elkins. From childhood, Peter has been fascinated by the convergence of community, leadership, business and entrepreneurialism. 
</p>

<p>
Today, Peter is an accomplished operator with growth transition and leadership acumen. Before moving to Victoria in 2012, Peter built his reputation as an management consultant with Kaufman. Peter returned to Vancouver as the CEO of GMD, an emergency medical device company that he took from idea to exit. Not surprisingly, being a paramedic in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside inspired his entry into the emergency medical device sector.
</p>

<p>
Since arriving in Victoria, Peter has co-founded the Capital Investment Network, a grassroots organization dedicated to building Vancouver Island's local living economy eco-system through connecting investors and entrepreneurs.  Peter is a compassionate, mindful entrepreneurial leader who thrives on the support he provides.
