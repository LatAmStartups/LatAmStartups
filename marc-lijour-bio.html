Marc Lijour helps organizations capture the benefits of the 4th industrial revolution.
</p>

<p>
The pressure is increasing on every single organization as billions of people and devices get connected, everything is getting digitized, and the pace of change is only getting faster. As innovation takes place in exponential ways, 40% of today's Fortune 500 companies will not exist in ten years. Tremendous value is created by those who seize the right market at the right time. Most of the new 'unicorns' will rise to the top in a matter of years, with perfect execution leveraging Free/Libre Open Source Software and the power of collaboration.
</p>

<p>
For more than 10 years, Marc has lead several strategic change initiatives in the private and public sector. He worked for the government of Ontario for seven years, before joining Cisco to lead Education in Canada as part of the Industry Transformation Team. Since 2015, he is developing business in Ontario for Savoir-faire Linux, a system integrator focusing on Free/Libre and Open Source Software across industries (particularly in banking, telecommunications, and aerospace). On his spare time, Marc heads several strategic projects at Prepr, to help organizations and individuals realize their entrepreneurial dreams. He also serves as Officer on the Board of the Information and Communications Technology Council (ICTC).
</p>

<p>
Marc Lijour holds an MBA in the Management of Technology and Innovation from Ryerson University, an IT Executive Leadership Certificate from Leaders Beyond (formerly CIO Summit), a BSc in Computer Science from Ryerson University, and a Licence de math√©matiques from University of Paris.
