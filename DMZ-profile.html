LatAm Startups Conf 3.0 is pleased to announce the Digital Media Zone (DMZ) at Ryerson University in Toronto as a Silver Sponsor.

The <a href="http://dmz.ryerson.ca/">DMZ at Ryerson University</a> is the leading business incubator for technology startups in North America, fuelling the success of emerging entrepreneurs. The DMZ is one of our country’s largest business incubators for emerging technology startups. 
</p>

<p>
The top-ranked university-based incubator in North America and third in the world, it fuels entrepreneurs with the resources to grow their startups into successful companies. The DMZ connects them with customers, advisors, influencers and other entrepreneurs as part of a community that supports and fosters disruptive technologies that transform businesses and lives. 
</p>

<p>
The DMZ is based at Ryerson, but it’s not just for students; this unique ecosystem is home to entrepreneurs and innovators of all ages from across Toronto, Canada and the world.  Overlooking the heart of downtown Toronto at Yonge-Dundas Square, the DMZ is a hub of innovation and collaboration. 
</p>
