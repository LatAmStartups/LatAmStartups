<p>
Ian is a tech veteran with 22 years of experience in security engineering and leadership roles at companies including BlackBerry, Sony and Motorola Mobility (under Google). He currently leads NCC Group’s Embedded Systems Security practice which provides companies with guidance on building secure, connected products&mdash;hardware and software  from IoT to mobile to automotive.
</p>

<p>
His team is unique in its real-world experience with manufacture, integration and repair implications to the resilience of shipping products. Ian is also passionate about human factors and staunch in his view that ease of use and security don’t have to be at odds in well-designed solutions.
</p>

<p>
When he isn’t herding hackers and breaking things, Ian is happiest when snowboarding or scuba diving (though obviously not at the same time!).
