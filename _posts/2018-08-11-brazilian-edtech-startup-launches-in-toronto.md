<p>
Sometimes you need a global team to scale globally.
</p>

<p>
Brazilian Lucas Pinto is the founder of Cerbo. Or rather, one of the co-founders--the other three are from France, China, and the US.
</p>

<p>
And Cerbo's co-founders decided to launch their startup not from the US, France, Brazil, or China, but from Canada. They chose the LatAm Startups acceleration program to scale their business globally.

<p>
Cerbo signed up for our two-week Scaleup Bootcamp Toronto, and applied to stay for the three-month softlanding program. During those three months, they learned how take advantage of Toronto as the ideal place to launch their startup globally, and have even hired local engineering talent.

<p>
Diversity is a strength for a Cerbo, and Toronto is the ideal place for them to continue to grow their business.
