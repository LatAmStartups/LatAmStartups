Couldn’t make it to that once-in-a-lifetime conference in Silicon Valley?
</p>

<p>
Startup Canada and LatAm Startups have you covered. Get your business cards ready!

We’re inviting you to shake hands with Canada’s top entrepreneurs, innovators, investors, politicians, and government decision-makers at <a href="https://www.startupday.ca">Startup Canada Day on the Hill</a>.

You’ll walk away with cutting-edge insights from those working to build Canada into the innovation-nation of the future. It’s your opportunity to connect with leaders, receive invaluable mentorship advice, participate in policy hack-a-thons and pitch competitions, and connect with the who’s who of entrepreneurship and innovation during a Startup Soiree overlooking the iconic Parliament Hill.
