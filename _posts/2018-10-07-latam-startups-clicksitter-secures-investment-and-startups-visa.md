LatAm Startups is pleased to announce that a graduate of our softlanding program has secured an investment letter and sponsor for a Canadian startup visa.

ClickSitter co-founders Luciana Pereira and Taric Andrade were part of the first LatAm Startups cohort in 2017.

Luciana and Taric left their careers in Brazil, where they worked at Unilvere, PepsiCo and KPMG, to launch ClickSitter, and have since moved their family and company to Canada to grow their business here.

ClickSitter is a mobile application to help parents find pre-qualified babysitters in Brazil. ClickSitter screens babysitters so parents can hire someone they can trust. As parents themselves, Luciana and Taric bring their own frustrations in finding good babysitters to their work.
