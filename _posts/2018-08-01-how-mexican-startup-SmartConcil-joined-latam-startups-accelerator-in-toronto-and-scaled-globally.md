Victor Salinas joined LatAm Startups to grow his fintech business--and succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Salinas started Aiontech nine years ago in Mexico. The company today has 30 employees and counts banks like HSBC among their clients.
</p>

<p>
When the time came to scale globally last year, Victor chose Toronto because, unlike Silicon Valley, Toronto is a major global financial hub, home to most of Canada's largest banks, and the Canadian branches of global banks. Toronto is fertile ground for a fintech startup.

<p>
In September 2017, Salinas realized that his SmartCouncil software was growing massively in popularity among his clients, and chose this product, among several in his portfolio, to scale globally first.
</p>

<p>
As SmartCouncil was developing in the market, Victor noticed he could launch a second startup, something that he experienced and know well. A transaction platform allowing students to receive money in a very efficient way through a virtual wallet. The niche for EasyTransfer will start with students from Mexico coming to Canada under the student visa, EasyTransfer projects to grow to the USA market in 2019, Europe and other local markets in Latin America in 2020.
</p>

<p>
EasyTransfer is a Canadian and Mexican company, he could launch in less than three months, understand the ecosystem and reach out experts in this area that are helping his company to get to the next level in a very short time.
</p>

<p>
Victor has brought two of the products to the Canadian market through the LatAm Startups programs, finishing up with a special pitch presentation at LatAm Startups Conf 5.0

<p>
“Bringing our product to Canada has been a good challenge for the company, but without the guidance and support from Latam Startups it couldn´t be possible. If you want to enter this market, you should talk with Latam Startups, to have a better chance to success”
