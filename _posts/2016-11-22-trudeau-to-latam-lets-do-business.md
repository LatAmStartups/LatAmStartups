Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/apec-summit-lima-peru-justin-trudeau-1.3858388">told the APEC Summit in Peru</a> over the weekend that Canada must build stronger trade ties with Latin America.
</p>

<p>
"We need to think beyond the United States and engage with Mexico in a positive way and engage beyond Mexico to Latin and South America," Trudeau said. "These are the things that I think are exciting about the coming years."

The move comes in response to the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. The CBC reports:
</p>

<blockquote>
But for Canada in particular, the greatest shock has been the election of a U.S. president who not only rejects the TPP but has also signalled he's willing to withdraw from NAFTA unless he can force his North American partners to agree to terms more favourable to the U.S.
</blockquote>

<p>
Trudeau avoided criticizing Trump, but made clear his desire to build stronger trade ties with Latin America.
</p>

<blockquote>
"The alignment that I'm seeing between the values of...Latin Americans in general, and where Canada wants to go, what role Canada wants to play in the world, is a tremendous opportunity," Trudeau said.
</blockquote>

<p>
LatAm Startups welcomes the Canadian prime minister's interest in Latin America. Future growth in trade ties with Latin America will be in the innovation and technology sector.
</p>

<p>
For the last three years, LatAm Startups has promoted greater connections between the Canadian and Latin American startup ecosystems, and we will continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
Increasing trade ties between Canada and Latin America is a "win-win" for both Canada and Latin America.
</p>

<p>
LatAm Startups will continue to work to achieve this vision, and we are at the Canadian government's service if they desire our expertise.
