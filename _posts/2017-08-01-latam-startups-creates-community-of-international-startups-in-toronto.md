The first four-month cohort of eight startups from Latin America finished on July 31, 2017. LatAm Startups brought high-tech companies working in IoT, cybersecurity, AgTech, Creative Industries, Energy, and IT to Toronto, and to Canada. Many are incorporating their business in Canada, and plan to hire local talent.

<p>
Number one big takeaway from the startups?

<p>
They felt like a part of the Toronto tech community, and in turn built their own small community--many saying they plan to mentor the second cohort of startups, slated to arrive in mid-September for a three-month acceleration program.
</p>

<p>
Market research suggests that Latin American startups need a three-month, rather than four-month, acceleration process.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of our success stories:
</p>

<p>
<strong>“For me, those four months were just the beginning of a new journey and new friendships. Everyone in the HUB taught me something new and I really thankful for that”</strong> Taric Andrade, CEO at <a href="https://www.clicksitter.ca/">Clicksitter</a>.
</p>

<p>
AgTech company SmartFarm was accepted into the accelerator program at Helix Seneca.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“I've grown so much in these four months, not only as entrepreneur but also as person. LatAm's support was crucial for all of our accomplishments and we will be forever thankful for all of the opportunities the program provided. So much learning, so much growth. Our history will definitely be defined in before and after LatAm.”</strong> Rebeca Souza, CEO of <a href="http://smartfarm.farm/">SmartFarm</a>
</p>

<p>
Inkspired, a platform connecting writers with readers, became the first Latin American startup to be featured in Startup Here Toronto, and is exploring some exciting new opportunities we hope to share with you in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“LatAm Startups helped us to develop new partnerships, connections and reach great opportunities in North America, which led to a greater exposure, traction, and even investment talks. If you believe your StartUp is actually a ScaleUp, this is a great fit for you”</strong> Galo Vargas, CEO at <a href="https://getinkspired.com/en/">Inkspired</a>
</p>

<p>
Two companies, cybersecurity startup MobiSec and IoT startups Byond, pivoted their businesses during the acceleration program.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“The Latam Hub was a great experience to Byond, connecting us to the local ecosystem. Canada is a great country that embraces international diversity and I would love to see it more open to bring international startups.”</strong> Rafael Leite, CEO at <a href="https://byond.us/">Byond</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Thank you for this wonderful experience. It was great to be part of this first hub with such awesome startups. We made business partners, marketing strategies, business plans,... and friends. Thank you all for sharing knowledge and experiences, it was unforgettable”</strong> Michel Traub, co-founder at <a href="http://mobisec.com.br/">Mobisec</a>
