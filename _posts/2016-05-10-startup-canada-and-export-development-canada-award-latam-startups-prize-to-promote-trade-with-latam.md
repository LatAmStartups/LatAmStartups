The Fund has been created in memory of Dr. Adam Chowaniec, former Chairman of the Startup Canada Board of Directors and board member of EDC. Chowaniec is known in Canada’s tech community for his involvement in starting, growing, and selling more than a dozen companies. He was a champion of the grassroots entrepreneurship movement in Canada, and of high-growth export companies. He passed in February 2015 following a battle with cancer.

Grant funds will be awarded to individuals, groups and organizations to build up the export and international capability of entrepreneurs across Canada. Project examples may include trade missions, global ecosystem tours, soft landings programs, export training bootcamps and global partnership facilitation, etc.

*Projects will be adjudicated based on criteria related to need, impact and the propensity of the initiative to enhance entrepreneur connectivity to global export training, mentorship or infrastructure; global customers, finance, industry anchors, talent; and, global markets.*
