<p>
We are pleased to announce that the third annual LatAm Startups Conf will take place this October in Mexico City.
</p>
<p>
Mexico's importance as both a producer of world-class startups and as a huge market for Canadian startups cannot be over-emphasized. The ease of doing business with Mexico from Canada makes it the obvious entry point for startups looking to "go LatAm."
