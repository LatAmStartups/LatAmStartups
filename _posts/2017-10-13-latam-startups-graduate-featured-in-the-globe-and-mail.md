Ms. Souza is still launching her startup, but she feels confident about its potential for growth in a country where agriculture is as economically important as it is in Brazil. She said three investors are interested in her company, and it was accepted into the HELIX accelerator program at Seneca College last summer.

<p>
"Right now we are adjusting our product," said Ms. Souza, who came to Canada in 2016 with a business visitor visa. "We have to translate the whole app into English, including the farming terms that are used here. And provincial regulations vary, so we have to figure that out as well."
</p>

<p>
The advantages of Canada include its economic stability, she explained, as well as the presence of "pretty much every culture in the world. The economic relationships Canada has with the big markets like those of India, China and Latin America are great for business, especially a global business."

<p>
Ms. Souza is also impressed by the calibre of tech talent in Toronto. "It's amazing how qualified the people here are. It's easy to find someone who has worked in cutting-edge technology already, people who are essential for a company like mine to be on top of the game."
