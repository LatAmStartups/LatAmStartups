There’s no question Brazil and Canada share an affinity for agriculture, both count the sector as a key economic driver and both have begun to look into the future of farming through research and development.
</p>

<p>
So when Toronto’s LatAm Startups accelerator offered Brazil-based agricultural tech startup Agromarra a spot in its first four-month cohort, Rebeca Souza was quick to take a post as CEO launching the company’s Canadian branch under the SmartFarm name.

<p>
It was a great opportunity, says Souza. “Not just for the resources, there's an educational system in entrepreneurship in Canada that Brazil is (still) a little behind.”

The move has allowed SmartFarm  which develops QR code tagging for animals, enabling farmers and auctions to use their mobile app to understand each animal’s health, history and genealogy  to feed off Toronto’s pool of tech talent.

Since joining LatAm at the end of 2016, SmartFarm has bolstered its technological approach, working with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and analytics to fuel the farms of the future through more efficient management.

Souza, who’d studied in Toronto for a year in 2015, admits that in the beginning, navigating the market was a challenging process.
