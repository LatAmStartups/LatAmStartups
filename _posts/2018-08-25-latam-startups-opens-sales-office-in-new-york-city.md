<p>
LatAm Startups has opened a sales office in New York City in midtown Manhattan, just blocks from Times Square.
</p>

<p>
The sales office will helps Canadian and Latin American startups accelerate their businesses in the North American market.
</p>

<p>
A short flight from Toronto, New York City is the obvious next step for many startups looking to grow their business.
</p>

<p>
LatAm Startups has long been the innovation bridge between Canada and Latin America. We aim to strengthen that connection with our new foothold in the US market.
