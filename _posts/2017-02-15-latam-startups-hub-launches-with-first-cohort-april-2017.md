<p>
LatAm Startups Hub is thrilled to announce the official launch of the Hub with the first cohort of nine startups from Latin America.
</p>

<p>
Startups from eight countries applied, and the final group includes innovative, scalable startups from Ecuador, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina. Much to our surprise, more than half of applications came from Brazil, and seven of the successful nine startups are Brazilian.
</p>

<p>
The startups will be in residence in Toronto for four months, from April-July 2017.
