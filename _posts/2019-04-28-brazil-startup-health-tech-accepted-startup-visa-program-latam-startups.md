<h2>
Background
</h2>

<p>
Originally from Brazil, Athimos has been providing solutions to health practitioners for 11 years. With more than 30 years of experience in the health and technology sectors, these group of professionals realized a common problem that persists in the healthcare industry, no matter where it is located. 
</p>

<p>
Health practitioners and the patients are the core of the healthcare industry. However, the healthcare software currently available in the market are designed for logistics, administrative and other operational purposes, instead of the people most important to the industry. Realizing this problem, Athimos was created with a purpose to revolutionize the digital health care, providing the best practitioner-focused solutions, which in turn results in their ability to provide the best solutions to the patients. Their software solutions are efficient, flexible, affordable and user friendly. In addition, they also provide prediction of risks in patients to alert the practitioners of the possibility of potential problems.
</p>

<h2>
Why Canada?
</h2>

<p>
Canada makes sense for Athimos because it is a strategic location to enter the bigger American market. With Canada’s involvement in the NAFTA, it will be easier for Athimos to further expand to the United States and Mexico in the future. However, the Canadian culture, diversity, the support available for startups were the reasons why the company decided to have Canada as their entry point.
</p>

<h2>
Challenges
</h2>

<p>
The country has high income value and the highest GDP per capita in Latin America, with US$ 16,639 in 2018. Since 2003, the economy has had positive growth rates averaging 4.1%. This has remained positive in 2017 and 2018, even during the recessions experienced by Argentina and Brazil, proving Uruguay’s economic independence from its main neighbours. Its macroeconomic policies and the government’s commitment to diversify its markets and products within its major agriculture and forestry sectors have increased the country’s ability to withstand regional shocks. In addition, Uruguay have a high income per capita and a low level of poverty.
