<p>
LatAm Startups is pleased to announce that our fourth annual conference will take place in Toronto in June.
</p>

<p>
Investors, startups, and public policy folk come from across Latin America, Canada, and the US for three intense days of networking and learning.
</p>

<p>
The conference takes place June 7-9, 2017.

<p>
The first two days of conference will be optional tours of the local startup ecosystems, in Toronto and neighboring Waterloo. LatAm Startups ran similar tours in 2015, and they were incredibly popular.
</p>

<p>
The tours are likely to sell out quickly, as capacity is limited to 50 people (the number of people we can fit on a bus). Conference <a href="tickets.html">tickets are on sale</a> now at our special early bird price.
