    <li><b>Customer Usability Lab: </b>Customer feedback informs our test-and-learn development culture every step of the way. The Customer Usability Lab space at the Digital Factory is a place where our teams meet with our customers to test our solutions as we build them. It helps our teams understand what our customers want and need, and enables us to capture real time feedback and iterate on what has already been designed. </li> 
    <li><b>Scrum-ready workspaces:</b> From large huddle rooms to private meeting booths, the technology-forward design enables teams to collaborate across the Bank's footprint, and drives quality and efficiency of technical production for employees and scrum teams who use the agile methodology. The neighbourhood themes and meeting rooms are named after people and technologies that disrupted and transformed their industries. </li> 
    <li><b>Artful design and inspiration:</b> Artwork throughout acknowledges Scotiabank's history and inspires the future. The Digital Factory logo  a fusion between the traditional factory gear and a pixelated gear  encapsulates the transformation from analog to digital and Scotiabank's broader digital transformation. Proudly on display is a stylized Scotiabank Coat of Arms from the original version designed in 1921.
