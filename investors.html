		If you're an angel investor, you know how hard it is to find startups worth investing in.
		Too much money chasing too little value. Except...
		</p>
		
		<h3>Latin America Needs You</h3>
		<p>
		Across the region and around the world, the cost of innovation is dropping. Startups
		in Latin America are engaged in world-beating scientific research and innovation,
		but lack the experience to commercialize their businesses. And because most 
		successful LatAm startup founders wind up in Silicon Valley, the LatAm ecosystems
		lack the self-sustaining cycle of successful startup founders turned angel investors
		who invest in new startups to repeat the cycle all over again.
		</p>

		<p>
		With 800 million consumers and maturing economies taking their place at the First
		World table, you can't afford to ignore Latin America any longer.
