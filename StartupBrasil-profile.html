Start-Up Brasil, a National Startup Acceleration Program, is an initiative of the Brazilian Federal Government, created by theMinistry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação MCTI), managed by Softex and partnering with accelerators, to support new technology-based companies: startups.

Startups have the role of constantly revitalizing the market, but they need a healthy environment to develop and be successful. The accelerators play in this context as a market-oriented agent, usually in the private sector and with capacity for financial investment, and have the function of directing and strengthening startups’ development.
