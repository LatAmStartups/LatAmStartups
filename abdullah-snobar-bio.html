Abdullah Snobar is the Executive Director of the DMZ at Ryerson University, responsible for the strategic direction and continued growth of the DMZ.

Abdullah joined the DMZ in 2014 as Director of Community and Business Development. In that role, he established and led the team responsible for increasing and strengthening connections with industry and corporate leaders, with a dual focus on local and international outreach. This resulted in <a href="http://dmz.ryerson.ca/current-partners/">new partnerships</a> for the DMZ and exceptional business opportunities for DMZ startups.

<p>
Under Abdullah’s direction, the DMZ also grew its Entrepreneur-in-Residence portfolio and enhanced its <a href="http://dmz.ryerson.ca/about/advisors/">advisor</a> program to ensure DMZ startups have timely access to first-class experts across every sector and vertical. At the same time, Abdullah fostered closer engagement with students and stakeholders across faculties, resulting in new collaborations, events and initiatives.

Prior to joining the DMZ, Abdullah served the Office of the Dean at the Ted Rogers School of Management as the Manager of Undergraduate Student Relations and Development. As a campus leader and widely respected role model, Abdullah amplified the culture and empowered the student community of the business school, through the introduction of new local and international experiential programs for students, leadership training for student executives, and unprecedented opportunities for student involvement. Abdullah co-founded a Toronto-based group-buying platform in 2009 and helped build a non-profit foundation in Kenya that strives to improve the quality of living for the Maasai community, with a focus on women and youth.
