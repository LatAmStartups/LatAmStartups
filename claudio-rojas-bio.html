Claudio Rojas is Director at Hurt Capital Inc., a founder centric investment and venture capital platform.
</p>

<p>
For almost a decade, Claudio has established a track record in identifying world-class founder centric companies, investing during periods of uncertainty, and successfully holding for the long term. He holds domain expertise in founder-oriented ownership structures and consumer-oriented technology alongside an exceptionally long-term entrepreneurial mindset.

Claudio’s research on founder centrism, recently featured by the University of Oxford and the European Corporate Governance Institute, bridges the gap between scholarly inquiry and real-world application to investment.
