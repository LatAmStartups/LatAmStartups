<p>
Lana is an innovator and entrepreneur with a long career in market research and an award-winning portfolio of research inventions. She designed and executed hundreds of research studies for dozens of clients in a wide range of industries, yet she was not satisfied with mere charts and numbers, always pushing to understand the "deep why" behind human decisions. (Including her own.)
</p>

<p>
This curiosity put her on a quest to understand how human emotions work. In 2015, she founded Heartbeat AI, an Emotion Analytics platform that reveals insights into human behavior. Born and raised in the former Soviet Republic of Kyrgyzstan, educated in the US, and immigrating to Canada in 1999, her understanding of cultures and systems inspired her to build a platform to cross borders and cultures. Her career path took her from a United Nations' office in Central Asia to UNICEF New York, to corporate market research and analytics. She left the corporate world in 2009 to study psychotherapy and neuroscience.
</p>

<p>
The idea of creating an algorithm that understands fine-grained emotions came while volunteering at the hospice and listening to people expressing emotions in her therapy room. This work became the foundation of a comprehensive handcrafted taxonomy of human emotions. Today, she is focusing on building the Heartbeat team, growing Heartbeat SaaS and API business, and speaking about human-centred AI.
