<h3>
Personalized Service
</h3>
<p>
We take pride in being fully involved at partner level whenever our clients’ interests are at stake. We believe that partner involvement is key to establishing an efficient client-attorney relationship.
</p>

<p>
Our lawyers’ personal commitment and the manageable size of the firm allow
us to render truly personalized services to our clients and provide tailor
made solutions instead of boilerplate advice.
</p>

<h3>
Tax and Transaction Specialist
</h3>

<p>
The firm has particular expertise in tax law and regularly advises clients on complex national and international tax planning and tax litigation matters. Our tax team includes former tax experts of the Brazilian Federal Revenue as well as a former partner of a big four audit company. Most lawyers in the tax practice hold postgraduate degrees in tax law.

<p>
Accompanying clients on the sale and acquisition of companies and other assets is one of the core skills of Fleury, Coimbra & Rhomberg. Our corporate team represents clients in M&A and private equity transactions, structuring joint ventures and foreign direct investments of any kind, offering a proactive approach and sound strategic advice throughout all deal phases.
</p>

<h3>
International Reach
</h3>

<p>
With lawyers qualified to practice law in the U.S., Canada, several EU countries and Brazil, our team is constantly involved in cross-border matters and has coordinated the Brazilian market entry of innumerous foreign investors and undertakings. We also regularly advise Brazilian companies and private clients that wish to invest abroad on international corporate and tax aspects.
</p>

<p>
Our network of reliable partner firms and practitioners around the world allows us to put together expert teams to assist on specific international transactions and matters.
</p>
<p>
Although we attend clients from many countries and regions all over the world, we have developed particularly strong ties to clients from EU/EFTA countries (including without limitation Germany, Holland, France, Belgium, the UK, Austria and Switzerland), the U.S. and Canada. We are active members and “recommended lawyers” of a range of chambers of commerce, trade associations and similar institutions.
