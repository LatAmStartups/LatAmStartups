My passion is to transform innovation, entrepreneurship and quality education into a public good for millions of people. I talk about innovation and entrepreneurship because I learned to do it, on the field, getting my hands dirty, failing and succeeding. I co-founded the company Momento Cero and the nonprofit Fundación Entrepreneur, where I led for more than ten years, projects with regional impact. I innovated challenging learning and established “Learning by Playing” and I am also a LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Facilitator.

<p>
Currently, I am a board member of Laboratoria Chile, a social enterprise that identifies young women with high potential and gives them the opportunity to become awesome developers. I also work as and advisor for public and private institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean, building entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystems.
